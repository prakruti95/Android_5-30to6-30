Task: Combining All Concepts
Objective: Combine inheritance, static variables, this, super, and final in a real-world scenario.

Instructions:
Create a class hierarchy with the following structure:

Person class:

final String name
final int age
Constructor to initialize name and age.
Student class (inherits from Person):

int grade
Constructor to initialize name, age, and grade.
A method printDetails() that prints the student’s name, age, and grade.
Teacher class (inherits from Person):

String subject
Constructor to initialize name, age, and subject.
A method printDetails() that prints the teacher’s name, age, and subject.
School class:

Static variable totalPeople to count the number of students and teachers.
Static method addPerson() to increment the totalPeople count.
Static method getTotalPeople() to return the total count of people.
In the main function, create instances of Student and Teacher, call the printDetails() method for each, and use the School class to track the total number of people in the school.
